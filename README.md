## Description

If you want to find an apartment in Novi Sad or Nish you should change "base_url" in "config.py" to

"https://cityexpert.rs/izdavanje-nekretnina/novi-sad" or "https://cityexpert.rs/izdavanje-nekretnina/nis" respectively.

And don't forget to change 'params["polygonsArray"]' in "config.py", because this parameter is responsible for the city's areas.

In "config.py" you can see a lot of filters. For example variables "max_price" and "min_size" or values in "params" dictionary such us "minPrice", "maxSize", "floor", "furnishingArray" etc.

'params["polygonsArray"]' is responsible for the city's areas. By default, in my app it's around the city center.
